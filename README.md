# Analysis of the world population over the past 50 years

In this team project we investigated how the population of the planet has changed over the past 50 years.
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset

We were interested in answering such questions:
- how the world's population has changed over the past 50 years?
- which countries on each continent have the largest and smallest populations in 2022?
- how the population of the five countries with the largest population growth has changed over the past 50 years?
